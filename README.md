Homework 4

# Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 4 - Code Quiz.  The assignment was to create a code quiz with several caveats/rules that needed to be followed.

The quiz needed to
* Include a start button that begins a timer
* once the timer starts, a question is presented
* once the question is answered, another question is presented (this will test the ability to dynamically build html using javascript)
* if the question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock (in this quiz, its 10 seconds deducted)
* the game is over if the timer reaches zero OR if all answers are answered
* once the game is over, the user is asked to save their name or initials (which will save to local storage)
* the user should be able to view the high scores (testing the ability to retrieve data from local storage) and then return to the quiz

# Usage
The questions in this quiz are not difficult.  The quiz doesnt really test knowledge, but coding abilities instead.
